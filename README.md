Self-sensing and accurate positioning of obstacles is the core technology to realize unmanned driving of rail electric locomotive, the harsh conditions such as high dust, low light and strong occlusion in the underground have a great influence on the obstacle recognition results. Aiming at the problems of missed detection of distant targets, false detection of occluded targets and complicated calculation parameters in this scene, an accurate identification method of track obstacles in the safe operation area of electric locomotives MUV-YOLOv11 is proposed.
